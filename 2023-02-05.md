Jurgen Klopp on Liverpool's 'horrible start' in defeat at Wolves: 'How can I not be concerned?'

克洛普谈利物浦输给狼队的“可怕开局”：“我怎么能不担心”

While Jurgen Klopp talks of the 12 minutes that cost Liverpool in their 3-0 defeat to Wolves at Molineux, Paul Merson goes through the problems throughout the team that are undermining the Anfield club: 'At the end, it was cringeworthy'

当克洛普谈到利物浦在莫利纽球场0-3输给狼队的12分钟的代价时，保罗·默森回顾了破坏安菲尔德俱乐部的整个团队的问题："最后，这是令人扼腕的。

Jurgen Klopp rued Liverpool's 'horrible start' in their 3-0 defeat to Wolves and admits he is concerned about his team's ongoing struggles.

克洛普对利物浦在0-3输给狼队的比赛中的 "可怕的开局 "表示遗憾，并承认他对球队的持续挣扎感到担忧。

Liverpool lost a third consecutive Premier League away game for the first time in a decade as Wolves lifted themselves out of the relegation zone with a three-goal win. Joel Matip's own goal followed by a Craig Dawson strike put them two down inside 12 minutes.

利物浦连续第三次输掉了英超联赛的客场比赛，这是十年来的首次，狼队以一场三球的胜利让自己脱离了降级区。马蒂普的乌龙球和克雷格·道森的进球让他们在12分钟内落后了两分。

There was no way back despite an improved second-half display in which Liverpool pushed for a route back into the game and things got worse when Ruben Neves effectively ended the comeback hopes with a third on the counter-attack.

尽管利物浦在下半场的表现有所改善，但没有任何回旋的余地，而当鲁本·内维斯在反击中打进第三球时，情况变得更糟，实际上已结束了利物浦的的希望。

With Liverpool in 10th and closer to the relegation zone than the Champions League places, Klopp and his players find themselves under serious scrutiny.

随着利物浦排在积分榜排名第10，更接近降级区，而不是欧洲冠军联赛的位置，克洛普和他的球员发现自己受到了严重的审查。

"The start of the game was horrible, it is not allowed to happen," said Klopp.

克洛普说：“比赛的开始是可怕的，这是不允许发生的，”。

"There is the first 12 minutes, then it is OK for an away performance, where we created, we were there. We started extremely well in the second half, the first 20 to 25 minutes, it is a super away game without scoring. Then they score the third goal from a counter-attack.

“前12分钟，对于一个客场球队的表现来说是可以的。我们在下半场开始得非常好，下半场前20到25分钟，那是一场没有进球的超级客场比赛。但后来他们通过反击打进了第三个球。”

"We caused our own misery in that first 12 minutes. That cannot happen. It did. But it cannot. It is really tough to swallow. You can criticise, you can judge and you are probably right. I have nothing to say because these 12 minutes are not allowed.

“我们在前12分钟造成了我们自己的痛苦。这不能发生，可它确实发生了，但它不能。真的很难咽下这口气。你可以批评，你可以评判，你可能是对的。我无话可说，因为这12分钟是不允许的。”

"It is really difficult to summarise. The team is not full of confidence, but do you need a lot of confidence for that? To put your body between the ball and opponent? Stop the cross?

“这真的很难总结。球队并不充满信心，但你需要很多信心才行吗？把你的身体放在球和对手之间？阻止对方的传球？”

"How can I not be concerned? I cannot sit here and say it is ok because it is not. I got asked if it is because of last season, 63 games. It is clear that has influenced the start of the season but how long can we suffer that? It is February by my watch.

“我怎么能不担心呢？我不能坐在这里说这是可以的，因为它不是。我被问到是否因为上赛季的63场比赛。很明显，那已经影响了本赛季的开始，但我们能忍受多久呢？在我看来，现在已经是2月了。”

"It might have been a problem but today, the first 12 minutes, it is not allowed and this is outcome. This is not a 3-0 how a 3-0 looks with Wolves clearly better side. Maybe for 12 minutes and the end when the ball was their friend again."

“这可能是一个问题，但今天，前12分钟是不允许的，这就是结果。这不是一个3比0的样子，狼队显然是更好的一方。也许在12分钟和结束时，足球又成为了他们的朋友。”

Klopp was clear that he has not lost belief in himself as a coach - or the players who have brought him such success at Liverpool but are now falling short of their best form.

克洛普很清楚，他并没有失去对自己作为教练的信心--也没有失去对那些给他在利物浦带来如此成功但现在却没有达到最佳状态的球员的信心。

"I don't think they are at their best at the moment but I still know how good they are and how good they can be. But we cannot help ourselves in this moment.

“我不认为他们此刻处于最佳状态，但我仍然知道他们有多么的优秀，他们可以有多优秀。但在这个时刻，我们无法帮助自己。”

"Seven or eight players weren't involved in the first goal, seven or eight players weren't involved in the second goal, but all are affected by it. The start is horrible. Then it is normal, it is great. OK, no finishing. But at the moment it is always if if if and I can't hear it anymore."

“有七八名球员没有参与第一个进球，有七八名球员没有参与第二个进球，但都受到了影响。开局是可怕的，然后就正常了。”
