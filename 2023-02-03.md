Liverpool: How Jurgen Klopp's Reds have been hurt on the pitch by a 'brain drain' off it

利物浦：克洛普的红军在球场上是如何被球场外的 "人才流失 "所伤害的

Sky Sports News' senior reporter Melissa Reddy takes a look at the factors behind the scenes at Liverpool that are contributing to slump on it; "There has been a steady "brain drain," categorising Liverpool not just as a team in transition but a club in one"

天空体育的高级记者梅丽莎·雷迪看了看利物浦的幕后因素，这些因素导致了利物浦的低迷；“一直有稳定的 ‘人才流失’，这使得利物浦不仅是一支转型期的球队，而且是一个转型期的俱乐部”。

With Liverpool lying ninth in the Premier League table and yet to win a top-flight game in 2023, Sky Sports News' senior reporter Melissa Reddy analyses how the departure of key figures has left them as a club in transition.

随着利物浦在英超积分榜上排名第九，并且在2023年还没有赢得一场顶级比赛，天空体育的高级记者梅丽莎·雷迪分析了关键人物的离开是如何让他们这个俱乐部处于转型期的。

"We've created a situation where I can have all the best information from the best people."

“我们已经创造了一种情况，我可以从最好的人那里获得所有最好的信息。”

As Jurgen Klopp reclined in Hope Street Hotel's Sixth Boardroom, the same spot in which he penned his contract to become Liverpool manager in 2015, he was coloured by calmness.

当克洛普躺在希望街酒店的第六会议室时，也就是他在2015年签署合同成为利物浦主教练的地方，他的脸上带着平静的色彩。

It was approaching the German's third anniversary in charge of the club with no silverware to show for it with Liverpool beaten finalists in the 2016 League Cup and Europa League, plus the 2018 Champions League.

在德国人执掌俱乐部三周年之际，利物浦在2016年联赛杯和欧联杯中被击败，加上2018年的欧洲冠军联赛，没有任何奖杯可以展示。

Klopp, though, was unruffled. He had unwavering belief that the right people and processes were in place off the pitch to ensure success would follow on it.

不过，克洛普并没有被吓倒。他坚定不移地相信正确的人和程序在球场外已经到位，以确保球场上的成功。

His zen was warranted. Liverpool would soon scale unprecedented heights, becoming the first British team to hold the European Cup, European Super Cup, Club World Cup and league titles simultaneously.

他的禅意是有道理的。利物浦很快就会达到前所未有的高度，成为第一支同时拥有欧洲杯、欧洲超级杯、世俱杯和联赛冠军的英国球队。

Along with Manchester City, they redesigned what is required to be crowned champions of England. On the continent, they were the team to avoid.

与曼城一起，他们重新设计了获得英格兰冠军的要求。在欧洲大陆，他们是要避免碰到的球队。

Liverpool did indeed have smarts off-pitch sparking their swagger on it; chiefly Klopp, FSG president Mike Gordon, and sporting director Michael Edwards.

利物浦确实有场外的聪明才智来激发他们在场上的豪迈；主要是克洛普、FSG（Fenway Sports Group芬威体育集团）主席迈克·戈登和体育总监迈克尔·爱德华兹。

Only the manager remains of the 'three wise men' and when analysing what has gone wrong at Anfield - the side have already lost six times in the league, are 10 points adrift of the top four, out of both domestic cup competitions, and are at odds with their identity - it helps to start at the top.

在"三位智者"中只剩下主教练，在分析安菲尔德的问题时--球队已经在联赛中输了6次，与前四名相差10分，在国内两项杯赛中都出局了，而且与他们的身份不相符--从头开始分析会有帮助。

The Klopp-Edwards-Gordon trinity worked superbly in a professional as well as personal capacity. All vastly different characters, they were aligned by a collaborative, honest approach under a shared vision for what Liverpool should be and how to sustainably compete.

克洛普-爱德华兹-戈登三位一体在职业和个人方面都工作得非常出色。他们都是性格迥异的人，但在对利物浦应该是什么以及如何持续竞争的共同愿景下，他们通过协作和诚实的方法保持一致。

Klopp and Edwards would casually discuss prospective players, potential new staff, football infrastructure improvements and other significant matters over breakfast or lunch in the canteen at the training ground, before working through a more detailed analysis.

克洛普和爱德华兹会在训练场的食堂吃早餐或午餐时随时讨论未来的球员、潜在的新员工、足球基础设施的改善和其他重大事项，然后再进行更详细的分析。

They would present their vision to Gordon, who provided the finances and whatever other support was necessary, like when he intervened to rehabilitate relations with Southampton in order to land Virgil van Dijk.

他们会向戈登提出他们的愿景，而戈登则提供资金和其他必要的支持，就像他为了得到范戴克而干预恢复与南安普顿的关系。

The partnership between Klopp, Edwards and Gordon was unassailable, promoting a sense of authority, surety and harmony to decision-making at Liverpool.

克洛普、爱德华兹和戈登之间的关系是不可动摇的，促进了利物浦决策的权威感、确定性和和谐性。

In November 2021, Edwards confirmed he would step down from his position following the end of his contract in June 2022 to spend some time away from the game.

2021年11月，爱德华兹确认他将在2022年6月合同结束后卸任，离开球场一段时间。
