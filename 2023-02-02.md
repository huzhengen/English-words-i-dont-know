Jadon Sancho: Man Utd boss Erik ten Hag hopes Old Trafford reception will motivate forward to return to his best

杰登·桑乔：曼联主帅埃里克·滕哈赫希望老特拉福德的接待将激励他回到自己的最佳状态

Jadon Sancho made his first Manchester United appearance since October after a lengthy absence during the Carabao Cup semi-final second leg victory over Nottingham Forest; Erik ten Hag: "He's just started again"

杰登·桑乔在联赛杯半决赛次回合战胜诺丁汉森林的比赛，是他自去年10月以来首次为曼联出场；滕哈赫：“他刚刚重新开始”

Manchester United boss Erik ten Hag hopes Jadon Sancho can return to his best form after making his first appearance since October in Wednesday night's 2-0 victory over Nottingham Forest in the Carabao Cup semi-finals.

在周三晚上2-0战胜诺丁汉森林的联赛杯半决赛中，桑乔首次出场，曼联主帅埃里克·滕哈赫希望桑乔能回到最佳状态。

United will face Newcastle in the showpiece on February 26 after they beat Forest 2-0 in the semi-final second leg at Old Trafford to seal a 5-0 aggregate win.

曼联在联赛杯半决赛次回合在老特拉福德以2-0击败诺丁汉森林，以总比分5-0取胜，他们将在2月26日决赛中对阵纽卡斯尔联。

The foundations were laid with a 3-0 triumph at the City Ground in last week's first leg and quickfire goals in the second half from Anthony Martial and Fred rubber-stamped their trip to the capital.

上周首轮比赛在城市球场的3-0大胜，和马夏尔、弗雷德在第二回合的快速进球为他们的首都之行奠定了基础。

Another positive for United was the return of Sancho, who made his first United appearance since October after a lengthy absence.

曼联的另一个积极因素是桑乔的回归，他在长期缺席后自10月以来首次为曼联出场。

Sancho was "not in the right status or fitness state" having done an individual fitness programme in the Netherlands rather than travel to the squad's winter camp to Spain.

桑乔在荷兰做了一个个人健身计划，而没有前往西班牙参加球队的冬令营，因此 "状态和体能都不太理想"。

He returned to huge cheers from the Old Trafford crowd and Ten Hag is looking forward to getting the 22-year-old back to his best.

他在老特拉福德人群的巨大欢呼声中归来，滕哈赫期待这位22岁球员恢复到最佳状态。

"Most important players (have to) enjoy football, which gives energy, that gives them the motivation to act and to perform," Ten Hag said.

"最重要的球员（必须）享受足球，这给了他们能量，给了他们行动和表现的动力，"滕哈赫说。

"He has really high standards, he has great capabilities to contribute to our team and the team is improving, we are playing more in the opponent's half and his capabilities are coming more to the fore [then]. He can act on them more and have more touches on the ball and that gives him the best platform to perform.

“他有很高的标准，有很好的能力为我们的球队做出贡献，球队正在进步，我们在对手的半场踢得更多，他的能力也更加凸显出来。他能更多地对他们采取行动，有更多的触球机会，这给了他最好的表现平台。”

"I think it was great, the reception from the fans to him, and also that will give him even more a push to continue in the way he's now acting.

“我认为这很好，球迷对他的接待，也会给他更大的推动力，让他继续以现在的方式踢球。”

"He has just started again, he is back in Carrington, and hopefully he can keep that and really contribute to the team because when he is in form he is important to us."

“他刚刚重新开始，他回到了卡灵顿（卡灵顿训练基地——曼联的训练场），希望他能保持这种状态，真正为球队做出贡献，因为当他处于状态时，他对我们很重要。”

"He already showed his quality this season for instance, the game against Liverpool, a great goal, scored against Leicester, he had some really good games, Spurs, he already showed his great capabilities.

“他已经展示了他本赛季的实力，例如对利物浦的比赛，一个伟大的进球，对莱斯特城的比赛，他有一些非常好的比赛，热刺，他已经展示了他的伟大能力。”

"I hope when you are available all the time and play often together with the players we have now in the midfield and front line, our attacking play will improve and create more chances, then it's a process players enjoy more and better motivated to work together."

“我希望当你一直可以和我们的中场和前场球员一起踢球的时候，我们的进攻会有所改善，创造更多的机会，那么这是一个球员更享受的过程，也是更好的合作动力。”

It is United's first domestic final since 2018, when they lost the FA Cup, and puts them one win away from ending a six-year trophy drought, going back to the 2017 Europa League success under Jose Mourinho.

这是曼联自2018年以来的第一次国内决赛，当时他们丢失了足总杯。他们距离结束六年的奖杯荒只有一场胜利，这还要追溯到2017年穆里尼奥带领的的欧联杯的胜利。

Ten Hag knows it is not job done, adding: "It's good to reach the final, but it's not about reaching the final, it's about winning it that's going to be tough, a great opponent.

滕哈赫知道这不是工作，他补充道：“能进入决赛是件好事，但不是为了进入决赛，而是为了赢得决赛，这将是很艰难的，一个伟大的对手。”

"Now the focus is on the Premier League, in two days it will continue. It has to give the motivation in the first place, we want to bring that cup to the fans.

“现在的重点是英超联赛，两天后她将继续。它首先要给人以动力，我们想把那座杯带到球迷面前。”

"But in this moment I'm not looking ahead, we're focusing on other things, a big week is coming up, we have Crystal Palace and then two games against Leeds and they are going to be great games, derby games that we are looking forward to."

“但在这一刻，我没有展望未来，我们专注于其他事情，一个重要的星期即将到来，我们有对阵水晶宫和后面的利兹联两场比赛，它们将是伟大的比赛，是我们期待的德比比赛。”

Ten Hag signed midfielder Marcel Sabitzer from Bayern Munich on loan on transfer deadline day.

滕哈赫在转会截止日从拜仁慕尼黑租借了中场球员马塞尔-萨比策。

The Dutchman said: "We are really happy with that transfer because we need it after Donny van de Beek dropped out [for rest of the season] and now Christian Eriksen for a longer time [up to early May] and also for a short time also Scott McTominay is not available.

这位荷兰人说：“我们对这次转会非常满意，因为在多尼·范德贝克退出[本赛季余下时间]后，我们需要他，现在克里斯蒂安·埃里克森的时间更长了[到5月初]，而且斯科特·麦克托米奈也不能在短时间内参加。”

"So that gives us a shortage of midfield players and I know the player already from [former clubs] Salzburg and especially Leipzig. Great attitude and the right age: I am sure it [this move] will motivate him strongly."

“所以这让我们缺少中场球员，我在[前俱乐部]萨尔茨堡，特别是莱比锡已经认识了这位球员。伟大的态度和合适的年龄：我相信这[这次转会]将强烈地激励他。”
