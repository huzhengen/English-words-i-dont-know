报道和免费比赛集锦：1.068亿英镑的恩佐·费尔南德斯在切尔西的首秀中给人留下深刻印象，但8850万英镑的米哈伊洛·穆德里克在斯坦福桥的首次出场在半场就被换下；哈弗茨击中门柱，但平局意味着切尔西排名第九；富勒姆升至第六。

Fulham battled to a 0-0 draw at Chelsea to once again frustrate their big-spending neighbours, moved up to sixth in the Premier League and dealt another blow to their rivals' top-four hopes.

富勒姆0-0战平切尔西，再次挫败了他们的大手笔的邻居，在英超联赛中上升到第六位，并再次摧毁了对手晋级前四的希望。

Fulham had ended a near-17 year wait for a win in this west London derby last month at Craven Cottage and while they couldn't complete a first-ever league double over Chelsea, they added another point to their impressive tally on their return to the top-flight.

富勒姆上个月在克拉文农场结束了对这场西伦敦德比的近17年的等待，虽然他们没能完成对切尔西的首次联赛双杀，但他们在重返顶级联赛后又为他们令人印象深刻的积分增加了一分。

Chelsea came close, with Kai Havertz hitting a post in the first half and Conor Gallagher and David Datro Fofana agonisingly unable to convert late on but despite spending a record £322m in the January transfer window, this was an illustration there will be no quick fix for Graham Potter's side.

切尔西很接近进球，哈弗茨在上半场击中了门柱，康诺·加拉格尔和大卫·福法纳在最后时刻痛苦地未能改变比赛0结果，尽管在一月的转会窗口花费了创纪录的3.22亿英镑，但这也说明格雷厄姆·波特的球队不会有快速的解决办法。

Fofana was one of five winter-window arrivals on show over the course of the game, and while British transfer record signing Enzo Fernandez impressed just days after his £106.8m move - and almost scored with a fine effort from distance - £88.5m Mykhailo Mudryk struggled to get involved and was taken off at half-time in his first home game for the Blues. Potter later revealed the Ukraine international had been suffering with a "heavy cold".

在比赛中，福法纳是冬季到来的五名球员之一，虽然英国转会记录上的恩佐·费尔南德斯在以1.068亿英镑转会后几天就给人留下了深刻的印象--他差点以一记漂亮的远射得分，但以8850万英镑签下的米哈伊洛·穆德里克在他为蓝军进行的第一场主场比赛中努力参与，并在半场时被换下。波特后来透露，这位乌克兰国脚一直遭受着 "重感冒"。

Like Fofana, Noni Madueke, a £29m purchase from PSV, added some spark to Chelsea's attack, along with fit-again Raheem Sterling, but with just seven goals in their last 12 Premier League games Chelsea remain toothless in the final third and, although they're now up to ninth in the table, the nine-point gap to Manchester United, who have a game in hand, is looking increasingly difficult to overcome.

与福法纳一样，从PSV埃因霍温买来的2900万英镑的诺尼·马杜克为切尔西的进攻增加了一些火力，还有重新适应的斯特林，但在过去的12场英超比赛中，切尔西在对方禁区仍然没有进球，尽管他们现在在积分榜上排名第九，但与曼联的9分差距，看起来越来越难追上。
