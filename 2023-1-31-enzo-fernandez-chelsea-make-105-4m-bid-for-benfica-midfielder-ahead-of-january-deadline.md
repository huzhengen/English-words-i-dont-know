Chelsea are close to agreeing a deal for Benfica's Enzo Fernandez after making a £105.6m bid - the same value as the midfielder's release clause.

切尔西接近同意本菲卡的恩佐·费尔南德斯的交易，他们开出了1.056亿英镑的报价，这与这名中场球员的解约条款相同。

Todd Boehly's Blues want to structure that release clause fee in instalments, as paying in one go has Financial Fair Play and tax implications.

托德·波利（英超足球俱乐部切尔西的共同拥有者和主席）的蓝军希望以分期付款的方式来构建解约条款费用，因为一次性支付具有财务公平和税收方面的影响。

Chelsea have been in talks to sign the Argentina World Cup winner throughout this month but Benfica had refused to do business unless the Blues pay the €120m (£105.6m) release clause.

切尔西在这个月一直在谈判签下这位阿根廷世界杯冠军球员，但本菲卡拒绝交易，除非蓝军支付1.2亿欧元(1.056亿美元)的解约条款。

Chelsea had offered players on loan and on permanent deals but the Portuguese side refused to accept anything except the release clause figure.

切尔西曾向球员提供租借和永久合同，但葡萄牙方面拒绝接受任何条件，除非是解约条款。

The midfielder has once again told Benfica that he wants to join Chelsea. If Fernandez does move to Stamford Bridge, he would surpass the £100m Manchester City paid for Jack Grealish from Aston Villa 18 months ago, making him the most expensive Premier League signing ever.

这位中场球员再次告诉本菲卡，他想加盟切尔西。如果费尔南德斯真的转会到斯坦福桥，他将超过18个月前曼城花费1亿英镑从阿斯顿维拉买来的杰克·格雷利什，成为英超史上最昂贵的签约。

The 22-year-old wants to move to Chelsea but he has been training and playing since he was dropped for one game by Benfica for going on an unauthorised trip home to Argentina for a New Year's Eve party.

这位22岁的球员希望转会到切尔西，但自从本菲卡因为未经允许返回阿根廷参加新年派对而取消了一场比赛以来，他一直在训练和比赛。

Fernandez, who won the Best Young Player award at the 2022 World Cup with winners Argentina, played in Saturday's 3-0 league win at Santa Clara.

费尔南德斯 - 曾随阿根廷队在2022年世界杯上获得最佳年轻球员奖，在周六3-0战胜圣克拉拉的比赛中出场。

The west London side have also tried to sign other midfielders this month, including Brighton's Moises Caicedo and Everton's Amadou Onana.

这支西伦敦球队本月还试图签下其他中场球员，包括布莱顿的莫伊塞斯·凯塞多和埃弗顿的阿马杜·奥纳纳。

Chelsea's search for a midfielder comes amid question marks over the long-term futures of Jorginho and N'Golo Kante, whose contracts expire at the end of the season.

切尔西对中场球员的搜寻是在对若日尼奥和恩戈洛·坎特长期未来的问号中提出的，他们的合同在本赛季结束时到期。

Fernandez is in line for a big pay rise if he moves but Benfica have been trying to get him to sign a new contract as they anticipate clubs such as Real Madrid and Barcelona will try to sign him in the summer.

如果费尔南德斯转会，他的薪水将大幅上涨，但本菲卡一直在努力让他签下一份新合同，因为他们预计皇家马德里和巴塞罗那等俱乐部将在夏天尝试签下他。

Benfica boss: We can't stop Fernandez leaving if release clause is met

本菲卡老板：如果费尔南德斯的解约条款得到满足，我们无法阻止他离开

Speaking about Fernandez's situation ahead of Benfica's match away at Arouca on Tuesday night, Benfica manager Roger Schmidt said his club could not stop the Argentine midfielder leaving if the release clause is met.

在周二晚上本菲卡客场挑战阿洛卡的比赛之前，本菲卡主帅罗格·施密特谈到了费尔南德斯的情况，他说如果解约条款得到满足，他的俱乐部无法阻止阿根廷中场离开。

"We all know that we have a situation with Enzo that he has a clause in the contract, so that means if the player wants to and there's a club who pays this amount of money, you cannot stop that," he said.

“我们都知道恩佐的情况，他的合同中有一个条款，所以这意味着如果球员想要，而且有俱乐部愿意支付这么多钱，你不能阻止他，”他说。

"Of course, for this moment, you have to be prepared, we have to find solutions, but at the moment, he's our player, there's no deal.

“当然，在这个时刻，你必须做好准备，我们必须找到解决方案，但目前，他是我们的球员，没有交易。”

"We will see what happens in the next two days and I'm happy when the transfer window is closed and we can focus completely on the players in the squad and we can try to play a top season."

“我们将在接下来的两天里看看会发生什么，我很高兴转会窗口关闭，我们可以完全专注于阵容中的球员，我们可以努力打出一个最好的赛季。

Earlier this month, Schmidt criticised Chelsea's behaviour in their bid to sign Fernandez.

本月早些时候，施密特批评了切尔西签下费尔南德斯的行为。

"There is a club that wants him, they tried to attract him, but they know that they can only have him if they pay the clause," he said on January 5.

“有一家俱乐部想要他，他们试图吸引他，但他们知道只有支付条款才能得到他，”他在1月5日说。

"It's disrespectful to all of us, to Benfica. They're driving the player crazy. They pretend they want to pay the clause and then they want to negotiate."

“这对我们所有人，对本菲卡都是不尊重的。他们使球员 crazy。他们假装自己想支付条款，然后想谈判。”
